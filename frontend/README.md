# Sunset Motel Booking System

Sunset Motel Booking System is a full-stack motel booking application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, MySQL, JPA, Maven, Lombok, JUnit, and Mockito.

The application allows customers to search for available motel rooms by check-in date, check-out date, and guest count. Customers can select an available room, enter guest information, and submit a booking. The system also includes a protected admin dashboard where bookings and rooms can be managed.

This project was built as a local development and portfolio project to demonstrate full-stack application structure, REST API development, database-backed room availability logic, admin authentication, and automated service-layer testing.

## Backend API Endpoints

### Public Room Endpoints

### Public Booking Endpoint

```text

  "guestEmail": "guest@test.com",
  "guestPhone": "4065551111",
  "guestCount": 1,
  "roomId": 1,
  "checkInDate": "2026-07-01",
  "checkOutDate": "2026-07-03"
}
```

### Protected Booking Endpoints

### Protected Room Management Endpoints

```json
{
  "roomNumber": "401",
  "roomType": "Single Room",
  "pricePerNight": 79.00,
  "maxGuests": 1,
  "description": "Cozy single room with one twin bed."
}
```

## Environment Variables

The backend uses environment-variable fallbacks in `application.properties`.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=${DB_URL:jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/motel_db}
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USERNAME:root}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD:root}

app.admin.username=${ADMIN_USERNAME:admin}
app.admin.password=${ADMIN_PASSWORD:admin123}

app.cors.allowed-origins=${CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS:http://localhost:5500,http://127.0.0.1:5500}
```

Local development uses the fallback values. Production deployments can provide real values through environment variables.

### Backend Environment Variables

| Variable               | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DB_URL`               | MySQL database connection URL                                       |
| `DB_USERNAME`          | MySQL username                                                      |
| `DB_PASSWORD`          | MySQL password                                                      |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`       | Admin username for HTTP Basic Auth                                  |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`       | Admin password for HTTP Basic Auth                                  |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of frontend URLs allowed to access the backend |

Example production CORS value:

```text
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-site.netlify.app
```

## Frontend API Configuration

The frontend JavaScript files use a centralized API base URL.

In `frontend/script.js` and `frontend/admin.js`:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080";
```

For local development, this points to the Spring Boot backend running on `localhost:8080`.

For deployment, this value would need to be updated to the deployed backend URL, such as:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = "https://your-backend-service.onrender.com";
```

## Local Development Setup

### Backend

1. Open the backend project in Eclipse.
2. Make sure MySQL is running.
3. Make sure the `motel_db` database exists.
4. Start the Spring Boot application.
5. The backend should run on:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

### Frontend

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open the `frontend` folder.
3. Start Live Server.
4. Open the customer website:

```text
index.html
```

5. Open the admin dashboard:

```text
admin.html
```

## Local Admin Login

Default local admin credentials:

```text
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

These values are configured as local fallbacks and can be replaced with environment variables.

## Automated Tests

The backend includes automated JUnit and Mockito service-layer tests for core business rules.

Test coverage includes:

* Room creation validation
* Duplicate room number prevention
* Room update validation
* Room deactivate/reactivate behavior
* Booking request validation
* Invalid date handling
* Room capacity validation
* Inactive room rejection
* Double-booking prevention
* Booking cancellation logic
* Already-cancelled booking rejection

Current test classes include:

```text
RoomServiceImplTest
BookingServiceImplTest
MotelbookingApplicationTests
```

To run backend tests from the backend folder:

```bash
mvn test
```

The tests can also be run in Eclipse using:

```text
Run As > JUnit Test
```

## Current Limitations

This project is designed as a learning and portfolio project. It includes several production-style improvements, but it is not yet a fully deployed production application.

Current limitations include:

* Admin authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with an in-memory user
* Admin passwords are not yet stored in a database
* Passwords are not yet BCrypt-hashed
* No payment processing
* No email confirmations
* No deployed cloud database
* No production hosting configuration yet
* No pagination for large booking lists
* No customer account system
* No controller or security integration tests yet
* Frontend API base URL must be manually changed for deployment

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

* Database-backed admin users
* BCrypt password hashing
* Role-based admin accounts
* Email confirmation for bookings
* Payment processing
* Booking archive feature
* Pagination for admin booking results
* Production deployment
* Cloud MySQL database
* Production CORS configuration
* HTTPS setup
* More controller and security tests
* Frontend form validation improvements
* Better admin dashboard layout
* Use build-time environment configuration for frontend API URLs
